1,1,II,24-Jul,Friday,4:00,"""About four o’clock the next morning, though it was quite cloudy, accompanied by the landlord to the water’s edge, in the twilight, we launched our canoe from a rock on Moosehead Lake.""",N
2,5,II,24-Jul,Friday,Null,"""Having passed the small rocky isles within two or three miles of the foot of the lake, we had a short consultation respecting our course, and inclined to the western shore for the sake of its lee; for otherwise, if the wind should rise, it would be impossible for us to reach Mount Kineo, which is about midway up the lake on the east side, but at its narrowest part, where probably we could recross if we took the western side. """,N
3,6,II,24-Jul,Friday,Null,"""Having passed the small rocky isles within two or three miles of the foot of the lake, we had a short consultation respecting our course, and inclined to the western shore for the sake of its lee; for otherwise, if the wind should rise, it would be impossible for us to reach Mount Kineo, which is about midway up the lake on the east side, but at its narrowest part, where probably we could recross if we took the western side. """,N
4,8,II,24-Jul,Friday,Null,""" The Indian reminding us that he could not work without eating, we stopped to breakfast on the main shore southwest of Deer Island.""",N
5,10,II,24-Jul,Friday,Null,"""While I had my eye fixed on the spot where a large fish had leaped, we took in a gallon or two of water; but we soon reached the shore and took the canoe over the bar at Sand-bar Island, a few feet wide only, and so saved a considerable distance.""",N
6,11,II,24-Jul,Friday,Null,"""While we were crossing this bay, where Mount Kineo rose dark before us within two or three miles, the Indian repeated the tradition respecting this mountain’s having anciently been a cow moose—how a mighty Indian hunter succeeded in killing this queen of the moose tribe with great difficulty, while her calf was killed somewhere among the islands in Penobscot Bay, and, to his eyes, this mountain had still the form of the moose in a reclining posture.""",N
7,16,II,24-Jul,Friday,12:00,"""We approached the land again through pretty rough water, and then steered directly across the lake at its narrowest part to the eastern side, and were soon partly under the lee of the mountain, having paddled about twenty miles. It was now about noon.""",N
8,17,II,24-Jul,Friday,Null,"""We designed to stop there that afternoon and night, and spent half an hour looking along the shore northward for a suitable place to camp. At length, by going half a dozen rods into the dense spruce and fir wood on the side of the mountain almost as dark as a cellar, we found a place sufficiently clear and level to lie down on, after cutting away a few bushes.""",N
9,18,II,24-Jul,Friday,17:00,"""After dinner we returned southward along the shore, in the canoe, on account of the difficulty of climbing over the rocks and fallen trees, and began to ascend the mountain along the edge of the precipice.""",N
10,19,II,24-Jul,Friday,Null,"""From the summit of the precipice which forms the southern and eastern sides of this mountain peninsula, five or six hundred feet high, we probably might have jumped down to the water, or to the seemingly dwarfish trees on the narrow neck of land which connects it with the main. It is a dangerous place to try the steadiness of your nerves.""",N
11,20,II,24-Jul,Friday,20:00,"""When we got to the camp, the canoe was taken out and turned over, and a log laid across it to prevent its being blown away. The Indian cut some large logs of damp and rotten wood to smoulder and keep fire through the night. The trout was fried for supper.""",Y
12,1,III,25-Jul,Saturday,4:00,"""At breakfast, the Indian, evidently curious to know what would be expected of him the next day, asked me how I spent the Sunday when at home. I told him that I commonly sat in my chamber reading, etc., in the forenoon, and went to walk in the afternoon. At which he shook his head and said, “Er, that is ver’ bad.”""",N
13,2,III,25-Jul,Saturday,Null,"""We crossed a deep wide bay north of Kineo, leaving an island on our left and keeping up the eastern side of the lake. We then crossed another broad bay, which, as we could no longer observe the shore particularly, afforded ample time for conversation.""",N
15,4,III,25-Jul,Saturday,12:00,"""At length I jumped out onto the end of the pier against which the waves were dashing violently, in order to lighten the canoe and catch it at the landing, which was not much sheltered, but just as I jumped we took in two or three gallons of water. """,N
16,5,III,25-Jul,Saturday,16:00,"""We reached the Penobscot about four o’clock, and found there some St. Francis Indians encamped on the bank. """,N
17,7,III,25-Jul,Saturday,17:00,"""When we had gone about three miles down the Penobscot, we saw through the tree-tops a thunder-shower coming up in the west, and we looked out a camping-place in good season, about five o’clock.""",Y
18,1,IV,26-Jul,Sunday,4:00,"""The note of the white-throated sparrow was the first heard in the morning, and with this all the woods rang. Though commonly unseen, their simple ah, te-te-te, te-te-te, te-te-te, so sharp and piercing, was as distinct to the ear as the passage of a spark of fire shot into the darkest of the forest would be to the eye. We were commonly aroused by their lively strain very early.""",N
19,2,IV,26-Jul,Sunday,Null,"""We soon passed the island where I had camped four years before. The deadwater, a mile or two below it, the Indian said was “a great place for moose.” """,N
20,3,IV,26-Jul,Sunday,Null,"""We carried a part of the baggage about Pine Stream Falls, while the Indian went down in the canoe. A Bangor merchant had told us that two men in his employ were drowned some time ago while passing these falls in a bateau, and a third clung to a rock all night and was taken off in the morning.""",N
21,4,IV,26-Jul,Sunday,Null,"""Immediately below these falls was the Chesuncook Deadwater, caused by the flowing back of the lake. """,N
22,8,IV,26-Jul,Sunday,12:00,"""About noon we turned northward up a broad kind of estuary, and at its northeast corner found the Caucomgomoc River, and after going about a mile from the lake reached the Umbazookskus. """,N
23,9,IV,26-Jul,Sunday,13:00,""" Our course was up the Umbazookskus, but as the Indian knew of a good camping-place, that is, a cool place where there were few mosquitoes, about half a mile farther up the Caucomgomoc, we went thither.""",Y
24,1,V,27-Jul,Monday,5:00,"""Having rapidly loaded the canoe, which the Indian always carefully attended to, that it might be well trimmed, and each having taken a look, as usual, to see that nothing was left, we set out again,""",N
25,2,V,27-Jul,Monday,Null,"""descending the Caucomgomoc, and turning northeasterly up the Umbazookskus. This name, the Indian said, meant Much Meadow River. We found it now very wide on account of the rains. """,N
26,3,V,27-Jul,Monday,Null,"""Having paddled several miles up the Umbazookskus, it suddenly contracted to a mere brook, narrow and swift, the larches and other trees approaching the bank and leaving no open meadow. """,N
27,4,V,27-Jul,Monday,11:00,"""The Umbazookskus is called ten miles long. Having poled up the narrowest part some three or four miles, the next opening in the sky was over Umbazookskus Lake, which we suddenly entered about eleven o’clock in the forenoon.""",N
28,6,V,27-Jul,Monday,Null,"""The Indian said this was the wettest carry in the State, and as the season was a very wet one we anticipated an unpleasant walk. """,N
29,7,V,27-Jul,Monday,17:00,"""We were about midway its length on the south side. We could see the only clearing in these parts, called the “Chamberlain Farm,” with two or three log buildings close together, on the opposite shore, some two and a half miles distant. """,Y
30,1,VI,28-Jul,Tuesday,5:00,"""When we awoke we found a heavy dew on our blankets. I lay awake very early and listened to the clear, shrill ah, te te, te te, te of the white-throated sparrow, repeated at short intervals, without the least variation, for half an hour, as if it could not enough express its happiness.""",N
31,2,VI,28-Jul,Tuesday,Null,"""We reached the outlet in about an hour, and carried over the dam there, """,N
32,3,VI,28-Jul,Tuesday,15:00,"""We landed on the southeast side of the island, which was rather elevated, and densely wooded, with a rocky shore, in season for an early dinner….As we lay huddled together under the tent, which leaked considerably about the sides, with our baggage at our feet, we listened to some of the grandest thunder which I ever heard—rapid peals, round and plump, bang, bang, bang, in succession, like artillery from some fortress in the sky; """,N
33,4,VI,28-Jul,Tuesday,20:00,"""At the outlet of Chamberlain Lake we were overtaken by another gusty rainstorm, which compelled us to take shelter, ,,,At length, just before sunset, we set out again.""",N
34,5,VI,28-Jul,Tuesday,Null,"""It was a pleasant excitement, yet we were glad to reach, at length, the cleared shore of the Chamberlain Farm.""",Y
35,1,VII,29-Jul,Wednesday,5:00,"""When we awoke it had done raining, though it was still cloudy. The fire was put out, and the Indian’s boots, which stood under the eaves of the tent, were half full of water. """,N
36,2,VII,29-Jul,Wednesday,6:00,""" We decided to cross the lake at once, before breakfast; and before starting I took the bearing of the shore which we wished to strike, about three miles distant, lest a sudden misty rain should conceal it when we were midway.""",N
37,3,VII,29-Jul,Wednesday,Null,"""Leaving a spacious bay on our left, we entered through a short strait into a small lake a couple of miles over, and thence into Telos Lake""",N
38,4,VII,29-Jul,Wednesday,Null,"""By observing where the horizon was lowest, and following the longest of these, we at length reached the dam, having come about a dozen miles from the last camp. Somebody had left a line set for trout, and the jackknife with which the bait had been cut on the dam beside it, and, on a log close by, a loaf of bread. These proved the property of a solitary hunter, whom we soon met, and canoe and gun and traps were not far off. He told us that it was twenty miles to the foot of Grand Lake, and that the first house below the foot of the lake, on the East Branch, was Hunt’s, about forty-five miles farther.""",N
39,5,VII,29-Jul,Wednesday,Null,"""Following a moist trail through the forest, we reached the head of Webster Pond about the same time with the Indian, notwithstanding the velocity with which he moved, our route being the most direct. The pond was two or three miles long.""",N
40,6,VII,29-Jul,Wednesday,Null,"""This Webster Stream is well known to lumbermen as a difficult one.""",N
41,8,VII,29-Jul,Wednesday,20:30,"""The darkness in the woods was by this so thick that it decided the question. We must camp where we were. I knew that he had his knapsack, with blankets and matches, and, if well, would fare no worse than we, except that he would have no supper nor society.""",Y
42,1,VIII,30-Jul,Thursday,5:00,"""I aroused the Indian early to go in search of our companion, expecting to find him within a mile or two, farther down the stream. The Indian wanted his breakfast first, but I reminded him that my companion had had neither breakfast nor supper. """,N
43,2,VIII,30-Jul,Thursday,Null,"""We were obliged first to carry our canoe and baggage over into another stream, the main East Branch, about three fourths of a mile distant, for Webster Stream was no farther navigable.""",N
44,5,VIII,30-Jul,Thursday,Null,"""It was just below the mouth of Webster Stream. When we arrived he was smoking his pipe, and said that he had passed a pretty comfortable night, though it was rather cold, on account of the dew. """,N
45,6,VIII,30-Jul,Thursday,Null,"""As we were approaching the outlet he suddenly exclaimed, “Moose! moose!” """,N
46,7,VIII,30-Jul,Thursday,Null,"""I could not distinguish the outlet till we were almost in it, and heard the water falling over the dam there. Here was a considerable fall, and a very substantial dam, but no sign of a cabin or camp.""",N
47,8,VIII,30-Jul,Thursday,16:00,"""We decided to camp early that we might have ample time before dark. So we stopped at the first favorable shore, where there was a narrow gravelly beach, some five miles below the outlet of the lake. """,Y
48,1,IX,31-Jul,Friday,5:00,"""We had smooth but swift water for a considerable distance, where we glided rapidly along, scaring up ducks and kingfishers. But, as usual, our smooth progress ere long come to an end, and we were obliged to carry canoe and all about half a mile down the right bank around some rapids or falls. """,N
49,2,IX,31-Jul,Friday,17:00,"""It was some time before we found a camping-place, for the shore was either too grassy and muddy, ,,,We found that we had camped about a mile above Hunt’s, which is the last house for those who ascend Katahdin on this side. """,Y
50,2,X,1-Aug,Saturday,5:00,"""I caught two or three large red chivin within twenty feet of the camp, which, added to the moose tongue that had been left in the kettle boiling over night, and to our other stores, made a sumptuous breakfast. """,N
51,7,X,1-Aug,Saturday,17:00,"""We camped about two miles below Nicketow, covering with fresh twigs the withered bed of a former traveler, and feeling that we were now in a settled country, especially when in the evening we heard an ox sneeze in its wild pasture across the river. """,Y
52,3,X,2-Aug,Sunday,8:30,"""We reached the Mattawamkeag at half past eight in the morning, in the midst of a drizzling rain, and, after buying some sugar, set out again.""",N
53,8,X,2-Aug,Sunday,13:00,"""To save the trouble of pitching our tent, when we had secured our stores from wandering dogs, we camped in the solitary half-open barn near the bank, with the permission of the owner, lying on new-mown hay four feet deep.""",Y
54,4,X,3-Aug,Monday,5:00,"""We started early before breakfast, the Indian being considerably better, and soon glided by Lincoln, and stopped to breakfast two or three miles below this town.""",N
55,5,X,3-Aug,Monday,Null,"""The Sunkhaze, a short dead stream, comes in from the east two miles above Oldtown. """,N
56,6,X,3-Aug,Monday,17:00,"""We approached the Indian Island through the narrow strait called “Cook.” He said: “I ’xpect we take in some water there, river so high—never see it so high at this season. Very rough water there; swamp steamboat once. Don’t you paddle till I tell you. Then you paddle right along.”""",N
